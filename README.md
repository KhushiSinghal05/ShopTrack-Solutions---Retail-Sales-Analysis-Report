<h1>Steps for Analysis</h1>
<h3>Step 1: Data Cleaning</h3>
The initial step was cleaning the dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy for analysis:<br><br>

<b>1.) Gender Column:</b>
Converted 'w' to "Women" and 'm' to "Men" to resolve inconsistencies in the gender data.<br>
<b>2.) Quantity Column:</b>
Replaced textual representations like "ONE" and "TWO" with numeric values (1 and 2) to make the data more consistent for analysis.<br>
<b>3.) Shipping City:</b>
Standardized the city names by converting all values to uppercase to resolve case inconsistencies (some were in lowercase and others in uppercase).<br><br>
<h3>Step 2: Data Processing</h3>
In this phase, I processed the data to make it more useful for analysis:<br><br>

<b>1.) Age Group:</b>Created a new column by categorizing customers into three age groups based on the 'Age' column (e.g., 18-30, 31-50, 51+).<br>
<b>2.) Month:</b>Added a new column to extract the month from the 'Date' column, which enables month-wise analysis of sales and orders.<br><br>
<h3>Step 3: Data Analysis</h3>
After cleaning and processing the data, I performed the following analyses using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts:

<b>a.) Sales vs Orders Comparison:</b> A single chart compares the number of sales versus the number of orders across different months.<br>
<b>b.) Sales by Gender:</b> Analyzed who purchased more—Men or Women—using gender-based sales data.<br>
<b>c.) Order Status in 2022:</b> Identified the different order statuses in 2022 (e.g., Pending, Shipped, Delivered, Canceled).<br>
<b>d.) Top 10 States Contributing to Sales:</b> A list of the top 10 states that contributed the most to overall sales.<br>
<b>e.) Age and Gender Relationship:</b> Analyzed the relationship between age groups and gender based on the number of orders placed.<br>
<b>f.) Sales by Channel:</b> Identified which sales Channel contributed the most to the total sales.<br>
